Simplify execute `make.R`, which will: 
1. Download all external files;
2. Copy the content of the GitHub repo `deactivation_emotional_state` to `~/replication_emotional_state` or modify the `setwd` command on line 11 in `deactivation_emotional_state/make.R` and line 12 in `deactivation_emotional_state/make.ipynb` to match the local location of the repo.
3. Copy the contents of GitHub folder `deactivation_emotional_state/alethea` to a local location of `~/alethea`.
4. Execute the `data` module, creating the main analysis sample; 
5. Execute the `analysis` module, performing all of the analyses in the paper.
6. Note that this repo *does not* contain the data files used to produce the analyses in the paper, "The Effect of Deactivating Facebook and Instagram on Usersâ€™ Emotional State." Reproducing the analyses and outputs of this code requires applying to ICPSR for data access: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/about/cms/5024
